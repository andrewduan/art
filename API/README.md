### Movies API

## Purpose
  Create a sample Movie API for Movies CURD. It can be used to serve the Frontend code.

## Tech used
  # Nodejs,
  # Expression
  # Typescript
  # MongoDB


## To be added

1. Unit tests

2. To make it cleaner, we can add dependency injection to class.
At this moment for sample task like movie, it would be fine without Dependency injection(Over engineering maybe???)

3. We can also add validator middleware prior request

4. We can also introduce Docker

## To start

```
npm install
```

then
```
npm dev
```
